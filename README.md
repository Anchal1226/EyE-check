# Detecting Diabetic Retinopathy 

> Diabetic retinopathy (DR), also known as diabetic eye disease, is a medical condition in which damage occurs to the retina due to diabetes mellitus. It is a leading cause of
> blindness. Diabetic retinopathy affects up to 80 percent of those who have had diabetes for 20 years or more. Diabetic retinopathy often has no early warning signs. Retinal 
> (fundus) photography with manual interpretation is a widely accepted screening tool for diabetic retinopathy, with performance that can exceed that of in-person dilated eye 
> examinations.

The below figure shows an example of a healthy patient and a patient with diabetic retinopathy as viewed by fundus photography

### The motivations for this project are twofold:

- Image classification has been a personal interest for years, in addition to classification on a large scale data set.

- Time is lost between patients getting their eyes scanned (shown below), having their images analyzed by doctors, and scheduling a follow-up appointment. By processing images in real-time, EyeNet would allow people to seek & schedule treatment the same day.
